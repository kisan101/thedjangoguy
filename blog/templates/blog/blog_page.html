          <p class="blog_content mb-4">The most prestigious skill you can develop in today's digital world is coding. It teaches you how to think and how to solve problems.
          </p>

          <p class="blog_content mb-4">Coding teaches you to understand the foundation of the computer system. How a computer achieves its task and how it works.</p>

          <p class="blog_content mb-4">There are tons of programming languages in the market. They have their own capabilities. You might be confused about which language you should choose as a beginner.</p>
          
          <p class="blog_content mb-4">Don't worry in this article I am going to talk about the top programming language to learn in 2020 and how they can be used to achieve your dream projects.</p>

          <p class="blog_content mb-4">
            Here is my list of top 3 programming language to learn in 2020
          </p>

          <h4 class="mt-5">1. Python</h4>

          <p class="blog_content mb-4">Python is an interpreted, high level, general-purpose programming language. It can use for multiple purposes. It is easy to learn and beginner-friendly.</p>

          <p class="blog_content mb-4">Here is a simple python code:
          </p>

          <pre><code class="language-python">
         # a function to find even or odd number
         def evenOdd(num):
            if num % 2 == 0:
              print(f"{num} is even")
            else:
              print(f"{num} is odd")
          </code></pre>
          
          <p class="blog_content mb-4">Python is extremely used for Machine Learning and professional developer also uses it to build web, mobile, and desktop application as well.</p>

          <p class="blog_content mb-4">But Python is not suitable for desktop and mobile applications. I will talk about a suitable language shortly. It is much popular in backend development, machine learning, data science, automation, and scripting.</p>

          <p class="blog_content mb-4">According to the StackOverflow Developer Survey 2019, Python is the most wanted programming language in 2019.</p>

          <img class="mb-4" src="{% static 'blog/img/python.png' %}" class="w-100 mb-5 mt-4" alt="Python tops StackOverflow Survey2020">



          <p class="mb-4 blog_content">Python can be used in multiple fields like Data Science, Web Development, Machine Learning, Scripting, Software Development, Automation, etc.</p>

          <p class="mb-4 blog_content">According to indeed.com, the average salary of python developers in the United States is $120k +.</p>

          <p class="blog_content mb-4">Python being my personal favorite language, I would definitely suggest you get started with Python in 2020.
          </p>

          <h4 class="mt-5">2. JavaScript </h4>

          <p class="blog_content mb-4">JavaScript is high level, interpreted or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. Ok, you might be thinking what the hell he is talking about. right?</p>

          <p class="blog_content mb-4">Well in simple language, JavaScript is a programming language of the web. More than 75% of websites on the internet use JavaScript.
          </p>

          <p class="blog_content mb-4">
            Here is a simple snippet of JS:
          </p>

          <pre><code class="language-python">
              //function to find the even or odd number
              function evenOdd(num){
                  if(num % 2 == 0){
                    return "Even"; 
                  }else{
                    return "Odd";
                  }
                }
          </code></pre>

          <p class="blog_content mb-4">According to the StackOverflow Developer Survey report of 2019, JavaScript is the second most wanted language.</p>

          <p class="mb-4 blog_content">JavaScript has tons of amazing libraries and framework which make front-end development rapid. Here is the StackOverflow survey report of 2019 showing the top Web Frameworks.
          </p>

          <img src="{% static 'blog/img/js-framework.png' %}" class="w-100 mb-5 mt-4">

          <p class="blog_content mb-4">
            JavaScript can be used to build web, mobile, and even desktop applications. Most used javascript libraries are React, Vue.js, jQuery, Angular, etc.
          </p>

          <h4 class="mt-5">3. Java </h4>
          <p class="blog_content mb-4">
            Java is a Compiled programming language used in enterprise application development. It is used by plenty of software companies around the world to build large scale applications.
          </p>
          <p class="blog_content mb-4">  
          Java is also used to build native android applications. If you want to become an app developer, Java is right for you. It can also be used to develop websites.
          </p>
            <p class="blog_content mb-4">Here is Java Code to find Even or Odd number:</p>
              <pre><code class="language-python">
          import java.util.Scanner;

            class OddOrEven
            {
              public static void main(String args[])
              {
                int x;
                System.out.println("Enter an integer to check if it's odd or even");
                Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
                x = in.nextInt();

                if (x % 2 == 0)
                  System.out.println("The number is even.");
                else
                  System.out.println("The number is odd.");
              }
            }
          </code></pre>

          <p class="blog_content mb-4">Of course, it looks tedious than Python and JavaScript code mentioned earlier, but Java is a great language. There are lots of books about data structure, system design, software architect written in Java. So knowing Java is just like knowing English.</p>

          <p class="blog_content mb-4">At last, my suggestion is that get started with one of the above languages. When you become comfortable with one language, it is much easier to catch the next one.</p>

           <p class="blog_content mb-4"> Good Luck!!</p>
